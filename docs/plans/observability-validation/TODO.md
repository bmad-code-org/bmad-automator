# Observability And Validation TODO

## Phase-Scoped TODOs

Completed historical phases use the sections below as their preserved checklist record. New clean-context work should use phase-scoped TODO files and should not read later TODO files as acceptance criteria.

## Phase 05 - Session Runtime Diagnostics

- [x] Read Phase 04 handoff before starting.
- [x] Add diagnostic-aware session-state loader.

- [x] Preserve CSV outputs exactly.
- [x] Update recovery/troubleshooting docs.
- [x] Add session diagnostics tests.
- [x] Update implementation notes with preserved compatibility behavior.
- [x] Append Phase 05 handoff entry.

## Phase 06 - E2E Docs And Release Readiness

## Phase 07 - Review Remediation

- [x] Read README, TODO, implementation notes, handoff log, Phase 06 handoff, and 2026-05-22 review correction entry.
- [x] Resolve the structured diagnostics/event channel for key orchestration lifecycle/stage/state/session/policy decisions.
- [x] Add production structured diagnostics/events without breaking legacy command output.
- [x] Add tests for event emission and redacted context.
- [x] Validate parse contract schema leaves before sub-agent execution.
- [x] Add a regression test that invalid parse schema leaves return `parse_contract_invalid` and do not call the parser sub-agent.

- [x] Restore or explicitly document `tmux-wrapper kill-all` compatibility behavior.
- [x] Run focused Phase 07 tests.
